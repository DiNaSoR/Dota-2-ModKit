# Dota 2 ModKit Reborn

### [Download the latest version here!](https://github.com/Myll/Dota-2-ModKit/releases)

## Dota 2 ModKit is now...

### Re-coded.

D2ModKit has been almost completely recoded. When I first started the project, it was my first C# project ever. The code became pretty ugly fast, to the point where I had to ctrl+f through everything to find code that I needed. So, it's been recoded in a more smarter manner with better design in mind!

### Re-designed.

D2ModKit now utilizes the open source [Metro WinForms](https://github.com/viperneo/winforms-modernui) framework for its UI. It's so beautiful, and it's the biggest motivation for me to do all this work on D2ModKit.

### Reborn compatible.

D2ModKit has been updated to work with Reborn's new file structure.

### Let's look at D2ModKit v2 in action:
